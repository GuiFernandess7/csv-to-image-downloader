# **How to Use**

### **Description**

This tool converts CSV files containing image URLs to JSON format and downloads the images to a local folder. It's a simple way to process image data and automate the image downloading process from a CSV.

### **Prerequisites**

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

1. **Git** â€“ For cloning the repository.
2. **Rust** â€“ To compile and run the program.
3. **Cargo** â€“ Rust's package manager to handle dependencies and run the project.

You can install Git and Rust by following the instructions on their official websites:

- [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

### **Step 1: Clone the Repository**

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GuiFernandess7/csv-to-image-downloader.git
```

This will download the project files to a folder named `csv-to-image-downloader`.

### **Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory**

Once the repository is cloned, change to the project directory:

```bash
cd csv-to-image-downloader
```

### **Step 3: Build the Project**

Now that you're in the project folder, you need to build the project with `cargo`, which handles the Rust compilation process:

```bash
cargo build
```

This will compile the project and download the necessary dependencies.

### **Step 4: Run the Project**

The project is designed to work with two modes: **convert** (to convert a CSV file to JSON) and **download** (to download images from URLs listed in a CSV file).

To run the project, use the following syntax:

```bash
cargo run -- <mode> <arguments>
```

#### Mode 1: Convert CSV to JSON

To convert a CSV file into JSON format, use the `convert` mode. For example:

```bash
cargo run -- convert --file-path path/to/your/file.csv path/to/your/output.json
```

This will read the CSV file at `path/to/your/file.csv`, convert it to JSON format, and save it as `images.json` (or any other output path you specify in the code).

#### Mode 2: Download Images from CSV URLs

If you want to download images from URLs listed in a CSV file, use the `download` mode. For example:

```bash
cargo run -- download --file-data-path path/to/your/file.csv --output-folder path/to/output/folder
```

This will:

1. Read the CSV file at `path/to/your/file.csv` to extract image URLs.
2. Download all images listed in the CSV and save them to the specified `output-folder`.

### **Step 5: Example CSV Format**

For the tool to work properly, your CSV file should have a structure like this:

```csv
id,name,url
1,Image 1,https://example.com/image1.jpg
2,Image 2,https://example.com/image2.jpg
```

- The **id** column is for any identifier.
- The **name** column is for the image's name or description.
- The **url** column should contain the full URL of the image to be downloaded.

### **Step 6: Output Files**

- **JSON Output**: When using the `convert` mode, the output will be a JSON file that contains the data from your CSV file in JSON format. Example:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Image 1",
    "url": "https://example.com/image1.jpg"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Image 2",
    "url": "https://example.com/image2.jpg"
  }
]
```

- **Downloaded Images**: When using the `download` mode, the images from the URLs in the CSV will be saved to the specified output folder.

### **Step 7: Troubleshooting**

If you encounter any issues while running the project, here are a few things to check:

- **Ensure that your CSV file is correctly formatted**: The program expects a valid CSV with columns for `id`, `name`, and `url`.
- **Check the image URLs**: Ensure the image URLs are valid and publicly accessible.
- **Permissions**: Make sure you have write permissions in the output folder where the images are being downloaded.
- **Dependencies**: If there are any issues with dependencies, try running `cargo update` to update them.

### **Step 8: Contributing**
